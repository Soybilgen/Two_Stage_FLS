## Information

This code shows how to estimate a two-step flexible least sqaure method that both deal with the instability of the parameters and the endogeneity in the equation.

As a case study, we have used this model to estimate a forward-looking Taylor rule policy function for the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey.

[Two_Stage_FLS.R](https://github.com/Soybilgen/Two_Stage_FLS/blob/master/Two_Stage_FLS.R) is the main file that produces results. [Two_Stage_FLS_Functions.R](https://github.com/Soybilgen/Two_Stage_FLS/blob/master/Two_Stage_FLS_Functions.R) includes necessary function to estimate a flexible least squares method.
